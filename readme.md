# AutoTMM

AutoTMM is a greasemonkey userscript aimed at practising whatever language you have to work with TellMeMore.

It all started last semester when I was asked to do 12 hours of TellMeMore. Dear teachers, I have better things to do.
Some afternoon I was bored, so I started fiddling around with greasemonkey and *voil√†*.

You can tweak the behaviour through greasemonkey script menu.

It will only check for french activities title, feel free to translate ;)
